# Cutting Casing with Pressure Pipe Cutter

## BHA

- Taper mill
- Pressure Pipe Cutter
- Non-rotating Stabilizer
- Crossover and DP to surface

## Procedures

1. Make up the BHA as above
2. Pick up and perform function test. Take note of the GPM required to open the cutter knives. The GPM will be the minimum rate to operate the cutter downhole.
3. Secure the knives inside the pocket with duct tape to prevent them from opening and tagging on obstructions.
   > Do not use soft line, wire, or tape with elasticit, which could block the knives from opening.
4. Confirm the cut depth with the client representative. RIH to cut depth.
   > Make sure the cut depth is not at the casing collar by reviewing the casing tally. Recommended to cut approximately 1-2 m above the casing collar.
5. At cut depth, establish:

- Pick up weight
- Slack off weight
- Rotating weight
- Free rotating torque at cutting rpm (without circulation)

6. Start rotation and slowly increase speed to the approximate cutting rpm (see table below). Fishing Supervisor shall recommend parameter adjustments as required.
   | Casing size to cut | Recommended starting rpm |
   | --- | --- |
   | 34" to 36" | 25 |
   | 20" to 30" | 30 to 40 |
   | 16" to 18-5/8" | 45 to 60 |
   | 9-5/8" to 13-3/8" | 60 to 70 |
